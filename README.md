# Building-end-to-end-pipelines-with-Sematic

Sematic is an open-source Continuous Machine Learning Platform Build used to run end-to-end ML pipelines effortlessly to retrain and improve your models continuously. It is a framework that enables users to build end-to-end machine learning and data science pipelines in a matter of days and not weeks. 

## Pipeline steps can notably include:
- Data processing – Apache Spark jobs, Google Dataflow jobs, or other map/reduce jobs
- Model training and evaluation – PyTorch, Tensorflow, XgBoost, Scikit Learn, etc.
- Metrics extraction – extract aggregate metrics from model inferences or feature datasets
- Hyperparameter tuning – iterate on configurations and trigger training jobs





> Note: Python versions 3.8 and 3.9 are supported.
